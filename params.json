The application gives the ability to do or redo the effect of a filter (Historic logic). Also, with just a screen \r\ntouch gesture, the user can zoom a specific region which makes \"ImgPro\" a very practical android application.\r\n###ImgPro Demonstration Screenshots:\r\n#####User Interface:\r\n![UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/device-2015-07-23-214602.jpg)\r\n#####A berber woman picture, used in this demonstation:\r\n(picture reference: Dzeriet magazine. www.dzeriet-dz.com):\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/org.jpg)\r\n####Point Processing effects:\r\n#####Decreasing the brightness of the picture:\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/bright%20-.jpg)\r\n#####Increasing the brightness of the picture:\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/bright%20%2B%2B.jpg)\r\n#####Adding contrast:\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/contrast%20%2B%2B.jpg)\r\n#####The sepia effect:\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/sepia.jpg)\r\n#####The greyscale effect:\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/greyscale.jpg)\r\n\r\n####Neighborhood Processing(requires convolution with a kernel)\r\n#####Making the picture sharper :\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/sharp.jpg)\r\n#####Detecting the edges:\r\n![alt tag](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/edge.jpg)\r\n#####Blur the picture(Box blur):\r\n![blur](https://github.com/Yanis-Boussad/ImgPro_Android-Image-Processing/raw/master/ImgPro%20Demonstration%20Screenshots/blur.jpg)\r\n\r\n###Remarks:\r\n - You may have problems importing the project to Android Studio.
