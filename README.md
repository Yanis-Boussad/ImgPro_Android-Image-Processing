# ImgPro 
## Android Image Processing Appication
### Presentation:
  ImgPro is an Android application that can process images stored in the memory storage of the Android Device, It gives the 
user a wide range of filters: from point processing filters (Greyscale, Sepia, Brightness and Contrast..), to the neighborhood 
processing which involves convolution of the original image with a 3-by-3 kernel in order to perform edge detection, sharpening
or blurring. The application gives the ability to do or redo the effect of a filter (Historic logic). Also, with just a screen 
touch gesture, the user can zoom a specific region which makes "ImgPro" a very practical android application.
